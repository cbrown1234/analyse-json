## Features TODO:
- ~~Add multi-file handling (dir/glob)~~
- ~~Add JSON path search~~ (Can be improved though)
- ~~Add parallelism to improve performance~~ ~~(Removed when refactoring as iterator adapters, will reconsider later)~~
- Statistical JSON schema inference
- Co-occurrence of fields matrix
- ~~"Addition" for file stats (Enables multi-file aggregation of stats)~~
- ~~Better terminal output~~
  - ~~Coloured~~
  - ~~tty dependent behaviour~~
- ~~Switch to a better JSON query implementation, considering:~~
  - ~~Consider for the query language~~
    - ~~https://github.com/freestrings/jsonpath~~ (using this for now)
    - ~~https://github.com/yamafaktory/jql~~
    - ~~https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.rs~~
    - ~~https://github.com/onelson/jq-rs~~
    - https://github.com/hiltontj/serde_json_path
    - https://github.com/V0ldek/rsonpath/tree/main/crates/rsonpath-lib
  - ~~Wrapper to keep track of source lines for 0/1 to many queries?~~
- ~~Refactor to implementation using iterator adapters~~ (First pass done, need some improvement)
  - consider itertools::process_results as a top level runner
- Check for existance (and type) of particular jsonpath
- ~~Enumerate lines from 1 rather than 0 (Maybe part of larger json wrapper struct refactor)~~
- ~~Refactor ndjson to use error wrappers with location info rather than tuples~~
- ~~Integrate graceful iterator adapter error handling (`Rc<RefCell<Vec<_>>>`) into filestats~~
- ~~Shell completion support~~
  - ~~Runtime creation~~
  - Build time creating
- CI/CD on github
